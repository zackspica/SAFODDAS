# DAS

Earthquake records are float32 binary. Their size is [800,1250].
800 channels [fast axis]
1250 time samples [slow axis]
Channel spacing - 1 m
Sampling frequency - 250 Hz (dt = 4 ms)

Cross-correlated waveforms available in the zip file. This includes a .mseed file as well as python .npy arrays. The filename or the station header indicate the depth of the central receiver used for estimation. These traces are bandpass filted between 5 and 20 Hz and are stack of 7 different one-day correlations.  

Maps, shot locations and receiver locations are provided for the conventional geophone survey. Only the first 2 shots are used (SP1 and SP2). Data are float32 binary, of size [2001,80]
2001 time samples [fast axis]
80 channels [slow axis]
Channel spacing - see geometry file PGSIarray_rec_coords_pos1.txt, nominal ~15m
Sampling frequency - 4 Khz (dt = 0.25 ms)

**All data are unprocessed - trace editing is required.**
